# About
I am a clinical research psychologist with a background in data science, Ecological Momentary Assessment, and intervention research. The crux of my research lies in elucidating the relationship between emotion and cognitive factors that maintain and exacerbate mental illness. 

To answer these questions, I focus on three primary research goals. First, to use multimethod experiments that draw from experimental psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, electrophysiological data, and ecological momentary assessment. Second, I consider aspects of assessment and user experiences to create surveys that are concise, direct, and user-friendly without sacrificing research integrity. Third, I aim to capitalize on methods from data science to improve our statistical models of prediction, which has enabled me to gain competencies in R, SPSS, Mplus, SQL, and additional programs, along with advanced statistical modeling techniques. 

After I completed my PhD in Clinical Psychology, I sought a postdoctoral fellowship at Boston Universityâ€™s Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders. Here, I balance both clinical work and clinical research. I am seeking a career conducting quantitative research on cognitive and emotional maintenance and risk factors for depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.
